=head1 NAME

IO::All::LWP - IO::All interface to LWP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::All;

    "hello world\n" > io('ftp://localhost/test/x');   # save to FTP
    $content < io('http://example.org');              # GET webpage

    io('http://example.org') > io('index.html');      # save webpage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module acts as glue between L<IO::All> and L<LWP>, so that files can be
read and written through the network using the convenient L<IO:All> interface.
Note that this module is not C<use>d directly: you just use L<IO::All>, which
knows when to autoload L<IO::All::HTTP>, L<IO::All::HTTPS>, or L<IO::All::FTP>,
which implement the specific protocols with base on L<IO::All::LWP>.

=head1 EXECUTION MODEL

B<GET requests>. When the IO::All object is opened, the URI is fetched and
stored by the object in an internal file handle. It can then be accessed like
any other file via the IO::All methods and operators, it can be tied, etc.

B<PUT requests>. When the IO::All object is opened, an internal file handle is
created. It is possible to that file handle using the various IO::All methods
and operators, it can be tied, etc. If $io->put is not called explicitly, when
the IO::All object is closed, either explicitly via $io->close or automatically
upon destruction, the actual PUT request is made.

The bad news is that the whole file is stored in memory after getting it or
before putting it. This may cause problems if you are dealing with
multi-gigabyte files!

=head1 METHODS

The simplest way of doing things is via the overloaded operators > and <, as
shown in the SYNOPSIS. These take care of automatically opening and closing the
files and connections as needed. However, various methods are available to
provide a finer degree of control. 

This is a subclass of L<IO::All>. In addition to the inherited methods, the 
following methods are available:

=over

=item * ua

Set or get the user agent object (L<LWP::UserAgent> or a subclass). If called
with a list, the list is passed to LWP::UserAgent->new. If called with an
object, the object is used directly as the user agent. Note that there is a 
default user agent if no user agent is specified.

=item * uri

Set or get the URI. It can take either a L<URI> object or a string, and 
it returns an L<URI> object. Note that calling this method overrides the user
and password fields, because URIs can contain authentication information.

=item * user

Set or get the user name for authentication. Note that the user name (and the
password) can also be set as part of the URL, as in
"http://me:secret@example.com/".

=item * password

Set or get the password for authentication. Note that the password can also
be set as part of the URL, as discussed above.

=item * get

GET the current URI using LWP. Or, if called with an L<HTTP::Request> object as
a parameter, it does that request instead. It returns the L<HTTP::Response>
object.

=item * put

PUT to the current URI using LWP. If called with an L<HTTP::Request> object, it
does that request instead. If called with a scalar, it PUTs that as the
content to the current URI, instead of the current accumulated content.

=item * response

Return the L<HTTP::Response> object.

=item * request

Does an LWP request. It requires an L<HTTP::Request> object as a parameter.
Returns an L<HTTP::Response> object.

=item * open

Overrides the C<open> method from L<IO::All>. It takes care of GETting the 
content, or of setting up the internal buffer for PUTting. Just like the
C<open> method from L<IO::All>, it can take a mode: '<' for GET and 
'>' for PUT.

=item * close

Overrides the C<close> method from L<IO::All>. It takes care of PUTting
the content.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module uses L<LWP> for all the heavy lifting. It also requires perl-5.8.0
or a more recent version.
