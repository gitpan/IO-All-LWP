=head1 NAME

IO::All::HTTPS - Extends IO::All for HTTPS URLs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::All;

    $content < io('https://example.org');   # GET webpage

    # two ways of getting a page with a password:
    $content < io('https://me:secret@example.org');
    $content < io('https://example.org')->user('me')->password('secret');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends L<IO::All> for dealing with HTTPS URLs. 
Note that you don't need to use it explicitly, as it is autoloaded by
L<IO::All> whenever it sees something that looks like an HTTPS URL.

The SYNOPSIS shows some simple typical examples, but there are many other
interesting combinations with other IO::All features! For example, you can get
an HTTPS URL and write the content to a socket, or to an FTP URL, of to a DBM
file.

=head1 METHODS

This is a subclass of L<IO::All::LWP>. The only new method is C<https>, which
can be used to create a blank L<IO::All::HTTPS> object; or it can also take an
HTTPS URL as a parameter. Note that in most cases it is simpler just to call
io('https://example.com'), which calls the C<https> method automatically.

=head1 OPERATOR OVERLOADING

The same operators from IO::All may be used. < GETs an HTTPS URL; > PUTs to
an HTTPS URL.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<IO::All>, L<IO::All::LWP>, L<LWP>.
