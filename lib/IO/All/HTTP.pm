=head1 NAME

IO::All::LWP - Extends IO::All to HTTP URLs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::All;

    $content < io('http://example.org');             # GET webpage into scalar
    io('http://example.org') > io('index.html');     # GET to file
    "hello\n" > io('http://example.org/index.html'); # PUT webpage

    # two ways of getting a page with a password:
    $content < io('http://me:secret@example.org');
    $content < io('http://example.org')->user('me')->password('secret');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends L<IO::All> for dealing with HTTP URLs. 
Note that you don't need to use it explicitly, as it is autoloaded by
L<IO::All> whenever it sees something that looks like an HTTP URL.

The SYNOPSIS shows some simple typical examples, but there are many other
interesting combinations with other IO::All features! For example, you can get
an HTTP URL and write the content to a socket, or to an FTP URL, of to a DBM
file.

=head1 METHODS

This is a subclass of L<IO::All::LWP>. The only new method is C<http>, which
can be used to create a blank L<IO::All::HTTP> object; or it can also take an
HTTP URL as a parameter. Note that in most cases it is simpler just to call
io('http://example.com'), which calls the C<http> method automatically.

=head1 OPERATOR OVERLOADING

The same operators from IO::All may be used. < GETs an HTTP URL; > PUTs to
an HTTP URL.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<IO::All>, L<IO::All::LWP>, L<LWP>.
