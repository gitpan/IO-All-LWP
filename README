IO-All-LWP version 0.10
=======================

This module acts as glue between IO::All and LWP, so that files can be read and
written through the network using the convenient IO:All interface.  Note that
this module is not "use"d directly: you just use IO::All, which knows when to
autoload IO::All::HTTP, IO::All::HTTPS, or IO::All::FTP, which implement the
specific protocols with base on IO::All::LWP.
